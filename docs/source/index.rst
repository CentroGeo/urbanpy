Welcome to urbanpy's documentation!
===================================

**A library to download, process and visualize high resolution urban
data in an easy and fast way.**

UrbanPy is an open source project to automate data extraction,
measurement, and visualization of urban accessibility metrics.

Functional goals
================

-  [x] Download open source spatial data (Limits & Points of Interests)
-  [x] Allow for the use of a grid system or administrative boundaries
   as spatial units
-  [x] Origin-destination matrix calculation by any mode using a routing
   API
-  [x] Obtain travel time from spatial units to the closest facilities
-  [x] Consolidate the results as tables and/or shapefiles
   (georeferenced datasets)
-  [x] Visualize the results as maps

UX goals
========

-  [ ] Atomic functions (one purpose per function)
-  [x] Use the power of Python Geospatial Ecosystem under the hood
-  [x] Allow to flexible processing pipelines (custom layer/metrics
   aggregations)
-  [x] Clear documentation with usage and examples
-  [x] Clear and replicable example notebooks
